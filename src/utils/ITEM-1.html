      <p><strong>1. A company is contemplating whether to use a client/server or a peer-to-peer network. What are three
          characteristics of a peer-to-peer network? (Choose three.)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>better security</li>
        <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>easy to create</strong></span></li>
        <li>better device performance when acting as both client and server</li>
        <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>lacks centralized administration </strong></span></li>
        <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>less cost to implement</strong></span></li>
        <li>scalable</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="message_box success">
        <p><strong>Explain:</strong><br>
          Because network devices and dedicated servers are not required, peer-to-peer networks are easy to create, less
          complex, and have lower costs. Peer-to-peer networks also have no centralized administration. They are less
          secure, not scalable, and those devices acting as both client and server may perform slower.<br>

      <div class="message_box success">
        <p><strong>Explain:</strong><br>
          A router is used to determine the path that the messages should take through the network. A firewall is used

      <ul>
        <li>extranet</li>

        <li>wireless WAN</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="message_box success">
        <p><strong>Explain:</strong><br>
          An extranet is a network area where people or corporate partners external to the company access data. An
          intranet simply describes the network area that is normally accessed only by internal personnel. The wired LAN
          is affected by BYODs (bring your own devices) when the devices attach to the wired network. A college wireless
          LAN is most likely used by the tablet and smartphone. A wireless WAN would more likely be used by college
          students to access their cell provider network.<br>

      <div class="message_box success">
        <p><strong>Explain:</strong><br>
          Cable and DSL both provide high bandwidth, an always on connection, and an Ethernet connection to a host

      <div class="message_box success">
        <p><strong>Explain:</strong><br>
          Cellular connectivity requires the use of the cell phone network. Satellite connectivity is often used where

      <p><strong>10. Which term describes the state of a network when the demand on the network resources exceeds the

      <ul>
        <li>convergence</li>
        <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>congestion</strong></span></li>

        <li>synchronization</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="message_box success">
        <p><strong>Explain:</strong><br>
          When the demand on the network resources exceeds the available capacity, the network becomes congested. A

      </div>
      <p><strong>11. Which expression accurately defines the term bandwidth?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>a method of limiting the impact of a hardware or software failure on the network</li>
        <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a measure of the data carrying capacity of the media</strong></span>

        <li>a state where the demand on the network resources exceeds the available capacity</li>
        <li>a set of techniques to manage the utilization of network resources</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="message_box success">
        <p><strong>Explain:</strong><br>
          A method of limiting the impact of a hardware or software failure is fault tolerance. A measure of the data
          carrying capacity is bandwidth. A set of techniques to manage the utilization of network resources is QoS. A
          state where the demand on the network resources exceeds the available capacity is called congestion.</p>

      </ul>
      <div class="message_box success">
        <p><strong>Explain:</strong><br>
          Cloud computing allows users to access applications, back up and store files, and perform tasks without

      <div class="message_box success">
        <p><strong>Explain:</strong><br>
          DSL is an always-on, high bandwidth connection that runs over telephone lines. Cable uses the same coaxial
          cable that carries television signals into the home to provide Internet access. Dialup telephone is much
          slower than either DSL or cable, but is the least expensive option for home users because it can use any
          telephone line and a simple modem. Satellite requires a clear line of sight and is affected by trees and other
          obstructions. None of these typical home options use dedicated leased lines such as T1/E1 and T3/E3.<br>

        <p><strong>Explain:</strong><br>
          The Internet provides global connections that enable networked devices (workstations and mobile devices) with
          different network technologies, such as Ethernet, DSL/cable, and serial connections, to communicate. A private
          network for an organization with LAN and WAN connections is an intranet.<br>

        <p><strong>Explain:</strong><br>
          Data integrity verifies that the data has not been altered on the trip between the sender and the receiver. A
          field calculated by the sender is recalculated and verified to be the same by the receiver. Passwords and
          authorization maintain control over who has access to personal data. Redundant devices and links attempt to
          provide 99.999% availability to users. Integrity is made possible by requiring validation of the sender, not
          the destination. VPNs are not the only secure method by which data can be transferred confidentially.<br>
