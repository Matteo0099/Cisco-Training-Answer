A SLAAC client can automatically generate an address that is based on information from local routers via Router Advertisement (RA) messages.

The original IPv6 specification defined site-local addresses and used the prefix range FEC0::/10, but these addresses were deprecated by the IETF in favor of unique local addresses.

Which three areas of concern should be accounted for when building a wireless network?

(Choose two.)","options":["EMI","signal attenuation","crosstalk","RFI​","extended length of cabling\n\n\n\n\nExplanation:\nEMI and RFI signals can distort and corrupt data signals that are carried by copper media. These distortions usually come from radio waves and electromagnetic devices such as motors and florescent lights. Crosstalk is a disturbance that is caused by adjacent wires bundled too close together with the magnetic field of one wire affecting another. Signal attenuation is caused when an electrical signal begins to deteriorate over the length of a copper cable.\n\n\n\n\n"],"answer":["EMI","RFI​"],"img":[]},{"question":"Data is being sent from a source PC to a destination server.

The source port number is added by the sending device and will be the destination port number when the requested information is returned. Layer 4 segments are encapsulated within IP packets. UDP, not TCP, is used when low overhead is needed. A source IP address, not a TCP source port number, identifies the sending host on the network.

The ping utility would be used to verify, or not, connectivity to the default gateway (router) using the configured default gateway address, or using the known correct default gateway address if these are found to be different. The arp -a or netsh interface ipv6 show neighbor commands could be used if the problem is then suspected to be an IP address to MAC address mapping issue.

First it determines if the destination device is on the local network or on a remote network. Then it checks the ARP table (not the MAC table) to see if a pair of IP address and MAC address exists for either the destination IP address (if the destination host is on the local network) or the default gateway IP address (if the destination host is on a remote network). If the match does not exist, it generates an ARP broadcast to seek the IP address to MAC address resolution. Because the destination MAC address is unknown, the ARP request is broadcast with the MAC address FFFF.FFFF.FFFF. Either the destination device or the default gateway will respond with its MAC address, which enables the sending node to assemble the frame.

IP is also media independent, which means it operates independently of the network media carrying the packets.\n\n\n\n\n"],"answer":["does not require a dedicated end-to-end connection","operates independently of the network media"],"img":[]},{"question":"What will happen if the default gateway address is incorrectly configured on a host?","options":["The host cannot communicate with hosts in other networks.","The host cannot communicate with other hosts in the local network.","A ping from the host to 127.0.0.1 would not be successful.","The switch will not forward packets initiated by the host.","The host will have to use ARP to determine the correct address of the default gateway.\n\n\n\n\nAnswers Explanation & Hints:\nWhen a host needs to send a message to another host located on the same network, it can forward the message directly. However, when a host needs to send a message to a remote network, it must use the router, also known as the default gateway. This is because the data link frame address of the remote destination host cannot be used directly. Instead, the IP packet has to be sent to the router (default gateway) and the router will forward the packet toward its destination. Therefore, if the default gateway is incorrectly configured, the host can communicate with other hosts on the same network, but not with hosts on remote networks.\n\n\n\n\n"],"answer":"The host cannot communicate with hosts in other networks.","img":[]},{"question":"Users report that the network access is slow.
